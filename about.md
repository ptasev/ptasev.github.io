I am a computer engineer based in Southern California. My main interests are programming, gaming, and playing basketball.  At this point, this website is mostly used to provide info for modding applications I have made.

For any questions regarding those applications contact me at modding@petartasev.com.
Otherwise, for general questions send an email to general@petartasev.com.
